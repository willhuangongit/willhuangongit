I am Will, and welcome to my GitHub repository. 

I am a quantative specialist with a yearning to be skilled at various aspects of the quantiative field, from theories to practical considerations, design, data collection, analysis, visualization, modeling, coding, implementation, prediction, automation, presentation and aiding decisions. I seek to make lives better by using data and quantiative methods to enrich our understanding of the world, make well-informed decisions and live in a better world.
